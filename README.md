# Forkify

Food Recipe Search Application with Shopping cart using external API.

This Application fetches data from an external API, then displays them using DOM Manipulation and JavaScript. 

Deployed using WebPack and Babel.

# How to use it

Enter your food that your are looking for at the top (like 'pizza' or 'salad' etc)

Then select a recipe from your left and the recipe will be displayed at the main screen. 

From there you can select the servings you need, add them to the 'virtual' shopping cart and look at direction on how to cook it!

You can always update the quantities in the shopping cart later if you need more.
